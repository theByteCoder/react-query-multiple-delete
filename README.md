This is a POC project for applying multiple delete functionality with react-query using useMutations.

We have provided a json-server along with the project. npm start will start the json-server on localhost port 3001 and react on port 3000.
Known issues : json-server - Multiple delete request (3+ request within a minute) crashes the server https://github.com/typicode/json-server/issues/1037. Please restart.

We have created a hook useDeleteHook and are passing array of row ids to be delete. The hook also taken in the url and a key.
Once the request(s) are inititated and returns a promise, we are pushing them in an array. We then attempt to resolve and return all the promises into the mutation.

This was, we are waiting for all the mutation requests to complete and then proceed.

Troubleshoot - While starting webpack, we can run into "compilerOptions.jsx must be react-jsx (to support the new JSX transform in React 17)" 
Solution - Go to the command palette CTRL+Shift+P. Choose "TypeScript: Select a TypeScript Version...". Choose "Use workspace Version".

steps to setup employees db - Installation URL (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/employees-installation.html)

The Employees database is available from Employees DB on https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db. You can download a prepackaged archive of the data, or access the information through Git.

To use the Zip archive package, download the archive and unpack it using WinZip or another tool that can read .zip files, then change location into the unpacked package directory. For example, using unzip, execute these commands:

shell> unzip test_db-master.zip
shell> cd test_db-master/

The Employees database is compatible with several different storage engines, with the InnoDB engine enabled by default. Edit the employees.sql file and adjust the comments to choose a different storage engine:

   set storage_engine = InnoDB;
-- set storage_engine = MyISAM;
-- set storage_engine = Falcon;
-- set storage_engine = PBXT;
-- set storage_engine = Maria;
To import the data into your MySQL instance, load the data through the mysql command-line tool:


shell> mysql -t < employees.sql
